# Recommendation Systems 🎯

This repository contains various recommendation system projects that I have worked on for practice and learning purposes. Recommendation systems are an important and widely-used application of machine learning and data science, and they are used in a variety of domains, such as e-commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

The repository includes the following recommendation system projects:

## [Fashion Recommendation System](https://github.com/Keyrun1227/FashionVision-Recommender) 👗

The [Fashion Recommendation System](https://github.com/Keyrun1227/FashionVision-Recommender) project focuses on providing personalized recommendations for fashion items, such as clothes and accessories. Users can input their preferences, and the system will suggest new items they might be interested in based on their past interactions and the preferences of similar users.

## Movie Recommendation System 🎥

The Movie Recommendation System project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. The system analyzes the user's viewing history and preferences, as well as the characteristics of the movies, to suggest new titles the user might enjoy. The recommendations can be based on genre, actors, directors, or other relevant attributes.

## Medical Recommendation System 🏥

The Medical Recommendation System project explores the use of recommendation systems in the healthcare domain. The system can provide recommendations for medical treatments or medications based on a patient's medical history, symptoms, and other relevant data. This can help healthcare professionals make more informed decisions and provide personalized care to their patients.
